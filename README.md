# Mental Health in Aboriginal Females vs Non-Aboriginal Females in Canada

## Description

The enduring intergenerational impact on the mental health of Indigenous communities can be traced back to the historical trauma inflicted by the residential school system [1].In Canada, studies have shown that Aboriginal women face poorer mental health outcomes than Aboriginal men [2]. Several studies also found that Aboriginal women in Canada experience significantly higher rates of depression compared to non-Aboriginal women [3]. Furthermore, Aboriginal women were also found to have a higher prevalence of pre-existing depression than non-Aboriginal women [4]. These findings suggest the importance of mental health support systems specific to First Nation women. 
To enhance cultural sensitivity and provide better support, communities need to develop resources and social services tailored to empower Indigenous women to take control of their health management [5]. A significant obstacle in attaining mental well-being for numerous Indigenous individuals is that the provided services might be insufficient or unsuitable due to the scarcity of mental health professionals who are culturally aware and informed [1]. 

Using the Canadian Community Health Survey -Annual Componet 2015-2016 and 2017-2018, the specific question I aim to answer through this project is:

- Is there a difference between the preference of mental health professionals between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal females? Has it changed between 2015 to 2018?

  In both groups and regardless of the year, the professionals of choice are the family doctors. It is interesting to note that the second most consulted specialist for Aboriginal females are social workers vs psychologists for non-Aboriginal females. It can also be noted that for Aboriginal females the percentage of consultations for family doctors and social workers diminished from 2015 and 2018 and for the rest of specialists it increased. As for non-Aboriginal females, only the percentage of consultations to psychologists increased (by 14.4%) while for the rest of the specialists it decreased.
